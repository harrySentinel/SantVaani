# üîß Blog Issues - Complete Fix Guide

You've created your first blog! üéâ But there are 4 issues to fix:

---

## ‚ùå Issue 1: Can't Upload Images

### **Problem:**
Image upload fails with error: "new row violates row-level security policy"

### **Solution: Run SQL in Supabase**

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **"New Query"**
5. Copy-paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Fix Blog Image Upload Policies

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated uploads to blog-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public read access to blog images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated updates to blog-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated deletes from blog-images" ON storage.objects;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads to blog-images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'santvaani-assets');

CREATE POLICY "Public read access to blog images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'santvaani-assets');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated updates to blog-images"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'santvaani-assets')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'santvaani-assets');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes from blog-images"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'santvaani-assets');
```

6. Click **"Run"**
7. Should see ‚úÖ "Success"
8. Try uploading image again - it will work!

## ‚ùå Issue 2: "Page Not Found" When Clicking Blog

### **Problem:**
After saving blog, clicking "Read More" shows 404 error

### **Possible Causes & Solutions:**

#### **Cause A: Blog Not Saved Properly**
- Check if blog appears in the blog list (admin panel ‚Üí Blogs)
- If not there, create it again

#### **Cause B: Wrong Slug Format**
- Slug must be lowercase, no spaces, use hyphens
- ‚úÖ Good: `hanuman-chalisa-benefits`
- ‚ùå Bad: `Hanuman Chalisa Benefits` or `‡§π‡§®‡•Å‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§ö‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä‡§∏‡§æ`

**How to check/fix:**
1. Go to Admin ‚Üí Blogs
2. Find your blog in the list
3. Click Edit
4. Check the **Slug** field
5. Make sure it's in English, lowercase, with hyphens
6. Example: `test-blog` or `my-first-blog`
7. Save again

#### **Cause C: Blog Status is "Draft"**
- Published blogs work, drafts might not show
- Check Status field = "Published" (not "Draft")

## ‚ùå Issue 3: Can't Exit Fullscreen

### **Problem:**
When you click "Maximize" to read full-screen, there's no obvious way to exit

### **Solution: The X Button Exists!**

**The close button is at the TOP-RIGHT corner:**
- Look for a small **X** icon
- It's in the top navigation bar of the reader
- Color: Gray/White (depends on theme)
- Click it to exit fullscreen

**Alternative Ways to Exit:**
- Press **ESC** key on keyboard
- Press **F11** (if true browser fullscreen)

**If still hard to see:**
I can make the X button bigger and more visible. Want me to do that?

## ‚ùå Issue 4: AI Not Working

### **Problem:**
Clicking "Generate SEO Suggestions" doesn't show AI suggestions

### **Debug Steps:**

#### **Step 1: Check Browser Console**
1. Open your admin panel
2. Press **F12** (opens Developer Tools)
3. Click **"Console"** tab
4. Go to Create Blog page
5. Fill title and excerpt
6. Click "Generate SEO Suggestions"
7. Look for this message:
   ```
   üîë Checking API key... Key found!
   OR
   üîë Checking API key... Key missing!
   ```

#### **Step 2: Based on Console Message**

**If says "Key found!":**
- Environment variable is working
- But API might be failing
- Check for other error messages in console
- Tell me what errors you see

**If says "Key missing!":**
- Environment variable not deployed
- **Fix:**
  1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
  2. Click your admin project
  3. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
  4. Find `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY`
  5. Make sure ALL THREE are checked:
     - ‚òë Production
     - ‚òë Preview
     - ‚òë Development
  6. If not checked, edit and check all
  7. Redeploy: Deployments ‚Üí "..." ‚Üí "Redeploy"
  8. Wait 3 minutes
  9. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R
  10. Try again

#### **Step 3: Check API Key Value**

**Verify in Vercel:**
1. Go to Vercel ‚Üí Your admin project
2. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Find `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY`
4. Click "..." ‚Üí "Edit"
5. Make sure Value starts with: `gsk_`
6. It should be the same as your chatbot API key
