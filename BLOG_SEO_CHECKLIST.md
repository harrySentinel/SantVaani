## 🎯 SEO Best Practices

### Keyword Research
Before writing, think about what your target audience is searching for:
- What questions do they have?
- What problems are they trying to solve?
- What terms would they type into Google?

**Tools to use:**
- Google autocomplete (start typing in Google search)
- Google "People also ask" section
- Google "Related searches" at bottom of results
- Think about your own spiritual journey - what did you search for?

### Content Structure
Make it easy for readers AND Google to understand your content:

```
H1: Main Title (only one per post)
  Introduction paragraph

  H2: First major section
    Content...

    H3: Subsection if needed
      Content...

  H2: Second major section
    Content...

  Conclusion paragraph
```

### Writing for Humans First
- Write naturally, don't force keywords
- Provide genuine value
- Answer questions completely
- Use examples and stories
- Make it engaging and readable

Google's algorithm is smart enough to understand context and meaning. Focus on helping your readers, and SEO will follow.
